## Play it online:

Here's a working version on Heroku:

## Installation

Fairly generic installation. There's some code in there to leverage a MySQL database, but it doesn't actually query it for anything yet just to play the game. Instead it pulls the words from a JSON file.

 - Copy the repo and enter it
 - # npm install
 - # npm start
 - Look for it at localhost:3000
